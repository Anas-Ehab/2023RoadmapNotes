# My Roadmap for 2023
**In this year I achieve on getting the following certificates**
1. CompTIA A+
2. CompTIA Linux+
3. CompTIA Security+
4. Cisco CCNA
5. CompTIA PenTest+
6. OSCP (The ultimate goal)

**Alongside these certificates I want to learn few extra programming languages and practice lots of CTFs. So i will be taking Python courses and doing CTFs on different sites**


## Phase 1 - The Basics
CompTIA Linux+ - Linux Mastery: Master the Linux Command Line in 11.5 Hours by Ziyad Yehia
CompTIA Security+ - CompTIA Security+ Study Guide by Mike Chapple & David Seidl
Cisco CCNA - Using Netacad resources
Python - The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python by Jose Portilla
CTFs - Finish CTFs on CTFLearn and PicoCTF

## Phase 2 - Next Step
CompTIA PenTest+ - Source to be determined later.
Another programming language that will be determined later (most likely a framework for javascript)

**After PenTest+ I will try to get as much experience as I can, I will try to work on Hackerone or other bug bounty sites and prepare for OSCP**

## Phase 3 - Get OSCP
OSCP - https://github.com/shreyaschavhan/oscp-pre-preparation-plan-and-notes


**I will try to not lose hope midway and for everything I learn I will try to make notes/mindmaps and upload it here in this repo.**
