| ==   | if the two operands are equal the value is true                                                |
| !=   | if the two operands aren't equal the value is true                                             |
| >    | if the left operand is greater than the right operand the value is true                        |
| <    | if the right operand is greater than the left operand the value is true                        |
| >=   | if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand the value is true            |
| <=   | if the right operand is greater than or equal to the left operand the value is true            |


## Chaining Comparison Operators
- To chain comparison operators we use logical operators which are, 
- "and" True only if all conditions are true.
- "or" True if any of the conditions are true.
- "not" True if the condition is not true.
